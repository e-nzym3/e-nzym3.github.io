Hey!
Jack here. I am the curious mind behind this blog.
If you are wondering how I ended up with such an amazing handle, let me dispel the mystery for you. I was in need of picking a name for my personal Github page so I grabbed a nearest-to-me piece of paper with writing on it and just picked a word from the page. That has pretty much been my method for picking nicknames, email addresses, and what nots throughout my life: find the nearest piece of paper with writing on it (whether itâ€™s a book, catalog, or manual), find a word, make it l33t, and roll with it.</description>
