Hey!

**Jack** here. I am the curious mind behind this blog. 

If you are wondering how I ended up with such an amazing handle, let me dispel the mystery for you. I was in need of picking a name for my personal Github page so I grabbed a nearest-to-me piece of paper with writing on it and just picked a word from the page. That has pretty much been my method for picking nicknames, email addresses, and what nots throughout my life: find the nearest piece of paper with writing on it (whether it’s a book, catalog, or manual), find a word, make it l33t, and roll with it. In this specific case, I believe it was a medical brochure that I have gotten from my doctor.

Now back to me. I have been into computers since I was a child. I remember my first ever game on my first ever computer: Jazz Jackrabbit 2. My Windows 95 computer could barely run it at a stable 15 FPS, but back in the day, it felt like the best gaming experience ever.

Ultimately, during my college years, I decided to slightly change my career path and pursue cyber security versus my current path of Cisco network management. I joined a cyber security club where I learned how to run Nmap scans, extract images from HTTP traffic using Wireshark, and hack WPS-enabled WiFi networks. I was hooked. The rest is history.

I have been in the IT security field for close to a decade, most of which I spent as a security consultant, conducting penetration tests of various kinds. Hacking has become a great outlet for my curiosity needs, as there is so much to explore and much of it is very much cutting edge. Also, hacking means so much more than just typing out commands to break into networks. There is social engineering for those who love human hacking. Lockpicking and physical testing for those that always wanted to get away with breaking and entering. This variety has kept my mind quite entertained.

While I do love hacking, I also love fishing. It is my outlet when I need time away from the bright screens. Nothing better than spending a warm, breezy morning on a beautiful Florida beach while trying to catch the biggest snook of your life.
