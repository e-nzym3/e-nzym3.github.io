## Intro

I have always been interested in things… many things. My mind is a constant torrent of ideas, questions, “hmm” thoughts. These often lead me on multi-hour research journeys. While learning many things can often seem like a good thing, it only is if you remember what you learned 2 or 3 days later.

Due to this, note taking has become a big part of my life, at least for the things I’m planning to remember days, months, or years later. While my current note taking solution, the almighty Obsidian, is great for noting down concepts, tools’ usage, and techniques, it does not always serve as a best method for knowledge sharing. After all, reading somebody’s notes is like taking a small peep into their brain. And THIS brain is quite a unique one.

## Why?

Sometimes I’ll show off something I’ve done, researched, or documented, and then get asked “how’d you do that?” or “where did you buy this?”. Well, instead of writing up a new email to answer those questions, I figured I would finally pull a trigger and create a site for just that purpose.

So here it is. Welcome.

I am no expert in things, so excuse the occasional n00bishness. I am a hacker and a life-long student. I am here to learn, likely just like you. These are my stories, my trial and error, my escapades. Treat them as such. They are not absolutes nor are they 100% true. But as they say: “if it works, it works”.

Hope you can find something of use to you here, perhaps something that just sparks an idea. In any case, thanks for visiting! See you around!
